# Deployment quickstart

By following this quickstart you will deploy an Azure TRE instance for training and evaluation purposes using the minimum amount of steps and actions.

## Prerequisites

To deploy an Azure TRE instance, there are a couple of prerequisites:

* [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com)
* Azure Active Directory tenant in which you can create application registrations.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

The Azure TRE solution contains a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with all the required tooling to develop and deploy the Azure TRE. To deploy an Azure TRE instance using the provided development container you will also need:

* [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Remote containers extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

## Clone the Azure TRE Git repository

Clone the Azure TRE Git repository on GitHub to your local computer.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE.git
```

The Git repository will host some basic configuration for the TRE instances that are deployed from a given repository. Create a new branch for the instance that you are about to deploy.

```bash
> cd AzureTRE
AzureTRE> git checkout -b quickstartenv
```

Now, let's open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code and connect to the development container.

```bash
AzureTRE> code .
```

> Visual Studio Code should recognize the available development container and ask you to open the folder using it. For additional details on connecting to remote containers, please see the [Open an existing folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) quickstart.

When you start the development container for the first time, the container will be built. This usually takes a few minutes.

## Set environment configuration variables of shared management resources

Open the `/devops/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `devops` folder.

The `/devops/.env` file contains configuration variables for the shared management infrastructure which is used to support the deployment of one or more Azure TRE instances.

You need to provide values for the following variables:

* `LOCATION` - The Azure region to deploy to
* `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` - Resource group name
* `MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` - Storage account name
* `ACR_NAME` - Container registry name
* `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Azure subscription id

Comment out the following variables by starting the line with a hash `#`.

* `ARM_TENANT_ID`
* `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
* `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`

The rest of the variables can have their default values. You should now have a `.env`file that looks similar to below.

```plaintext
# Management infrastructure
LOCATION=westeurope
MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=aztremgmt
MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=aztremgmt
TERRAFORM_STATE_CONTAINER_NAME=tfstate
IMAGE_TAG=dev
ACR_NAME=aztreacr

ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=12...54e

# Azure Resource Manager credentials used for CI/CD pipelines
# ARM_TENANT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=__CHANGE_ME__

PORTER_OUTPUT_CONTAINER_NAME=porterout

# Debug mode
DEBUG="false"
```

> To retrieve your Azure subscription id, you can use the `az` command line interface available in the development container. In the terminal window in Visual Studio Code, type `az login` followed by `az account show` to see your default subscription. Please refer to `az account -help` for further details on how to change your active subscription if desired.

## Set environment configuration variables of the Azure TRE instance

Next up, you will set the configuration variables for the specific Azure TRE instance.

Open the `/templates/core/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `/templates/core` folder.

The Azure TRE API is protected by Azure Active Directory. This requires an application registration for the API and another application registration for the Open API UI.

Use the terminal window in Visual Studio Code to execute the following script from within the development container:

```bash
/workspaces/tre> ./scripts/aad-app-reg.sh -n aztreqs -r https://aztreqs.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/oidc-redirect
```

> Note: `aztreqs` is a placeholder for the unique name you have to choose for your Azure TRE instance. Likewise `westeurope` is a placeholder for the location where the resources will be deployed, this should match the value you set on the location variable in the previous step.

With the output from the `add-app-reg.sh` script, you can now provide the required values for the following variables in the `/templates/core/.env` configuration file:

* `TRE_ID` - The identifier for your Azure TRE instance. Will be used for naming Azure resources. Needs to be globally unique and less than 12 characters.
* `AAD_TENANT_ID` - The Azure AD tenant id
* `API_CLIENT_ID` - Service principal id for the API
* `API_CLIENT_SECRET` - Client secret for the API
* `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` - Service principal id for the Swagger (Open API) UI

All other variables can have their default values for now. You should now have a `.env` file that looks similar to below.

```plaintext
#  Used for TRE deployment
TRE_ID=aztreqs
ADDRESS_SPACE="10.1.0.0/22"
TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.0.0.0/12"
MANAGEMENT_API_IMAGE_TAG=dev
RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_VMSS_PORTER_IMAGE_TAG=dev
GITEA_IMAGE_TAG=dev
DEPLOY_GITEA=true
RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_TYPE="vmss_porter"

# Auth configuration
AAD_TENANT_ID=72e...45
API_CLIENT_ID=af6...dc
API_CLIENT_SECRET=abc...12
SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID=d87...12
```

## Deploy the Azure TRE instance

You are now ready to deploy the Azure TRE instance. Execute the `all` action of the makefile using `make`:

```bash
/workspaces/tre> make all
```

Deploying a new Azure TRE instance takes approximately 30 minutes.

Once the deployment is completed you will be presented with a few output variables, similar to below.

```plaintext
app_gateway_name = "agw-aztreqs"
azure_tre_fqdn = "aztreqs.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com"
core_resource_group_name = "rg-aztreqs"
keyvault_name = "kv-aztreqs"
log_analytics_name = "log-aztreqs"
static_web_storage = "stwebaztreqs"
```

The Azure TRE instance is initially deployed with an invalid self-signed SSL certificate. This certificate needs to be replaced with one valid for your configured domain name. To use a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), run the command:

```bash
/workspaces/tre> make letsencrypt
```

## Validate the deployment

### Using curl

Use `curl` to make a simple request to the status endpoint of the API:

```bash
/workspaces/tre> curl https://<azure_tre_fqdn>/api/status
```

The expected response is:

```json
{"services":[{"service":"Cosmos DB","status":"OK","message":""}]}
```

### Using the API docs

Open your browser and navigate to the `/docs` route of the API:  `https://<azure_tre_fqdn>/docs` and click *Try it out* on the operation of choice.
